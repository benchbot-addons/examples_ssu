  Wraps the VoteNet 3D object detector from Facebook Research with an attempted
  solution for semantic SLAM tasks. It needs to be run for a task that uses
  "passive" mode (i.e. requires the action "move_next"). 

  The included Dockerfile allows running without manually installing VoteNet.
  Please note that the compilation of CUDA layers will have to be done every
  time though due to limitations in Docker's GPU support. For this reason, it
  is recommended to run this example natively where possible. 

  Please see the VoteNet repository for more details on the method:
